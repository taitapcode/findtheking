# FindTheKing

A strategic chess-inspired guessing game where players attempt to locate a hidden king on a chessboard within a limited number of moves.

## Game Overview

FindTheKing is a web-based puzzle game that combines elements of chess positioning with deductive reasoning. Players click on squares of an 8Ã—8 chessboard to find the hidden king, receiving distance clues to guide their search.

## How to Play

1. **First Click**: Click any square on the board to start the game and randomly place the king
2. **Distance Clues**: Each clicked square shows the shortest distance (king's move distance) to the hidden king
3. **Limited Guesses**: You have 5 attempts to find the king
4. **Win Condition**: Click on the exact square where the king is hidden
5. **King's Movement**: Distance is calculated using king movement rules (can move one square in any direction, including diagonally)

## Features

- **8Ã—8 Chessboard**: Classic chessboard layout with alternating light and dark squares
- **Chess Notation**: Board includes row numbers (1-8) and column letters (a-h)
- **Distance Feedback**: Visual feedback showing the minimum moves needed to reach the king
- **Game State Management**: Track remaining guesses and win/lose states
- **Reset Functionality**: Start a new game at any time
- **Medieval Theme**: Custom UnifrakturCook font and gradient background for atmospheric styling

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration
- **Styling**: CSS with custom properties and Tailwind CSS integration
- **Font**: UnifrakturCook-Bold for medieval theming

## Game Logic

The core game logic (`scripts/game.js`) includes:

- **Board Generation**: Creates an 8Ã—8 grid with chessboard pattern
- **King Positioning**: Randomly places the king after the first click
- **Distance Calculation**: Uses Chebyshev distance (king's move distance)
- **Game State**: Manages guesses, win/lose conditions, and board state
- **Visual Feedback**: Updates cells with distance numbers or king icon
